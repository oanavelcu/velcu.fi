"No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main." poet John Donne

According to a [2015 study in the National Bureau of Economic Research](http://www.nber.org/papers/w21473), social skills have a growing importance in the labor market. In order to succeed at work, experts need to keep on developing both their technical skills and "foundational skills", like empathy and creativity.

The work place is a space of co-creation and collaboration with others. The more we learn how to communicate and behave with our co-workers, the better we'll be able to divide tasks quickly and effectively between team members. People feel happier being part of a more productive team.

As part of the main, we need to be aware of the great value we could individually bring to the group. The more motivated, inspired and passionate we are about our individual work, the more valuable the outcome.
