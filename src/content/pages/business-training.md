## Leading for Creativity â€“ On Demand Course

Are you the kind of leader who believes that the best way to lead people is to inspire them? How much do you care about having people say to others that you make them love their job?

I want to invite you to my course, **Leading for Creativity**. The goal is to enable you to recognize the key concepts that form a culture of creativity and adaptability.

The course is designed based on my recently published book, [*How to Develop Your Creative Identity at Work*](https://www.amazon.com/Develop-Your-Creative-Identity-Work/dp/1484286790/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=creative+identity+oana&qid=1671788205&sprefix=creative+identi%2Caps%2C180&sr=8-1), which in turn, it draws on the latest research on the psychology of creativity.

### What topics will we cover?

We'll go through the core habits of a creativity-enabling workplace.

#### Work identity and values

### What will you get?

Each session will last 90 minutes. There will be first a 30 minutes presentation of the theoretical framework. The remaining 60 minutes will be group coaching. You'll walk away identifying new links between creativity habits and work performance.

This course is designed for groups of 8 participants. Send an email to [oana@velcu.fi](mailto:oana@velcu.fi). Once you sign up, you'll receive an invoice that needs to be paid two days before the session.

### Where and when do we meet?

Depending on the location of the participants, we'll organize virtual or face-to-face sessions.

## Leading Your People for Adaptability to Change

"No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main." poet John Donne

According to a [2015 study in the National Bureau of Economic Research](http://www.nber.org/papers/w21473), social skills have a growing importance in the labor market. In order to succeed at work, experts need to keep on developing both their technical skills and "foundational skills", like empathy and creativity.

The work place is a space of co-creation and collaboration with others. The more we learn how to communicate and behave with our co-workers, the better we'll be able to divide tasks quickly and effectively between team members. People feel happier being part of a more productive team.

As part of the main, we need to be aware of the great value we could individually bring to the group. The more motivated, inspired and passionate we are about our individual work, the more valuable the outcome.

### Areas

- Communicate with clarity
- Personal biases awareness
- Listening skills

### Who may benefit from this training?
- Leaders and change agents.
- Researchers.
- Programmers.
- Experts with creative and entrepreneurial roles in organisations.
- Newly formed interdisciplinary teams.

### Because organisational changes reflect the quality of conversations in teams. Direct and one to one conversations are the engine of change when the feeling of overwhelm is replaced by focus on priorities.

### Because being involved in organisational change means managing tension in work relationships. Self-awareness is like a breath of fresh air.

### Because lack of employee motivation to engage in change will result in overdue projects.

## Self-Leadership - Leading Yourself for Best Performance

- Creative thinking skills
- Work wellbeing

### Because we get the tendency to get attached to a particular way of thinking and a set of rules. And breakthroughs happen when we break free from the habitual thinking and dare to try out new things.

### In the same way we are interested in brushing our teeth twice a day, we can get interested in taking care of our emotional states.
