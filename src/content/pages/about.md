Researcher, author and coach. In my free time, I enjoy writing on my blog on the development of creativity, self-leadership and self-awareness.

My academic experience encompasses research and teaching in [Hanken School of Economics](https://www.hanken.fi/en) and [Aalto School of Business](https://www.aalto.fi/school-of-business).

In 2014, I got [certified](http://www.worldcoaching.com/) as a coach.

In March 2017, I got my second certification grounded in social neuroscience, by the [NeuroLeadership Institute](https://neuroleadership.fi/) in Helsinki.

My appetite for becoming better in my role as a coach and trainer grows with each customer interaction. One of the most valuable rewards is to see the smiles of insight on my clients' faces.
