Something wonderful happened to me when I became a mother. This biggest role of my life inspired me to press the refresh button. For instance, I started writing a [personal blog](https://www.flyingthoughts.net/).

Also, I embraced a career change after nine years of research and teaching experience in [Hanken School of Economics](https://www.hanken.fi/en) and [Aalto School of Business](https://www.aalto.fi/school-of-business).

In 2014, I got [certified](http://www.worldcoaching.com/) as a coach.

In March 2017, I got my second certification grounded in social neuroscience, by the [NeuroLeadership Institute](https://neuroleadership.fi/) in Helsinki.

My appetite for becoming better in my role as a coach and trainer grows with each customer interaction. One of the most valuable rewards is to see the smiles of insight on my clients' faces and watch their gait transform into a walk on clouds after our sessions.
