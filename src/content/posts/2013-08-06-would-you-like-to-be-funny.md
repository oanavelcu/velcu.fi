title: How to stay on the funny side of life
---

*You can choose to live your life as a comedy. Humour can positively change your perception on life experiences. If you think that life is more about serious matters, please reconsider. You can learn to see the funny side of life.*

Humour can bring lots of benefits in your life. It can make you happier and healthier by helping you cope with stress. It can help you heal if you have more serious traumas. It can make you more attractive in the eyes of the opposite sex.

It helps you see more of the beautiful side of life.

## First step - appreciate humour

One of my favourite movie characters is Guido, starred by Roberto Benigni in "La vita e bella", Life is beautiful. Guido's enthusiasm of life and amazing humour help him protect his son from the Nazi camp.

I wanted to be a little bit like Guido. My uncle was like him - gifted with creative humour in all sorts of life situations. Once we attended a wedding, where the guests were sitting at their tables and eating the festive food, with serious faces. The only place where laughters were soaring in the air was the corner where we were seated. After a few minutes of storytelling, uncle remarked, *"W*e wouldn't have so much fun i*f we weren't ourselves."*

As for myself, well, I was certainly capable to appreciate humour but was I capable to create my own humour? Could just anyone improve their sense of humour?
According to research done by [Nevo, Aharonson and Klingman (1998)](http://www.google.ro/books?hl=ro&lr=&id=v7e68zFtmRsC&oi=fnd&pg=PA385&dq=Nevo,+O.,+Aharonson,+H.,+%26+Klingman,+A.+(1998).+The+development+and+evaluation+of+a+systematic+program+for+improving+sense+of+humor.&ots=bSb5_FwRbt&sig=W_gbhSCdbvPRV4qJy6EoJWpGbM0&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false), on a sample of 101 female teachers, humour can be learned. The most efficient way to learn to be more humorous is to identify on your own what type of humour resonates mostly within you.

## Second step - Develop your personal humour

There seem to be at least [29 types](http://library.thinkquest.org/J002267F/types_of_humor.htm) of written and spoken humour. It's big enough a portfolio to have something for everyone.

My favourite types of humour are the self-deprecating, blunders, situational humour, and jokes. In my everyday life, situations often reflect these types of humour. How about you, which type of humour do you like?

The self-deprecating humour and the blunders can help changing your perception about the past and slowly let it go. It is human to look back at the past and lament over the painful moments.

You can teach yourself to look at the mistakes of the past and see how foolish they can appear in hindsight.

The situational humour - can help us get over embarrassing or tense moments, i.e. a date which does not go quite as expected. As a parent, I realised that there are moments throughout a day when instead of getting angry with my toddler, I choose to laugh.

For example, you step into your living room with freshly painted walls. You breathe in content the smell of paint when you notice your toddler's blue paint fingerprints on the wall.

Jokes, especially the inside jokes you have with your partner or close people are a wonderful way of bonding. At the same time, inside jokes can release the tension in moments of conflicts when suddenly you crack a joke which makes the other one burst out laughing.

Why dwelling on problems when you can boost your joy by finding the comic side of life.

A good laughter can save the day!

**How about you? What kind of humour would you like to bring more in your every day life?**
