## Risking to enter the vegetative state?

Some people, like a former work colleague, do not even want to have children. This ex-colleague of mine believed that having children turns the parents into vegetative beings whose only role is to serve their offspring. I was quite taken aback when he stated his view.

For more than one year, I have experienced motherhood and continuous sleep deprivation. I must admit that there are days when I am in a vegetative state. But this mood is only the shell of my inner being. Deep inside, each day brings into light a new layer of the love I have for my little one. Furthermore, until now, I have figured out that parenthood is a mysterious journey, which can't be anticipated.

## What does love for our children mean?

It is easy to love my child when he smiles, when he is playful and funny. The challenge comes when he is cranky, whining, screaming and lying on the floor in protest - he has such behaviours even if he is only 15 months old. In those moments of "family crisis", deep inside I love him equally and even more but at the surface, I am faced with negative emotions such as anger and irritation. And that's when the challenge lies. Keeping the calm and finding ways out of these moments of crisis are must-to-develop skills for me and any other parent, most certainly.

We all want to bring up healthy, balanced and loving children, who have happy and meaningful lives. It is though so tempting to expect from our children to live the life we want them to live. And here, there is another challenge of parenthood: letting our children grow into adults and avoiding to burden them with our expectations.

My son's uncle brings him toys and says, "He'll be an engineer". Sometimes I look at my son and I think, "He'll be a dancer". Few seconds after, I correct myself, "What are you thinking, woman? He'll be whatever he wants to be."

I don't need to decide on his behalf what will make him happy. Instead, I need to make sure he is loved and we are present for him when he needs us.

## Torn between love and setting limits

When he thinks he needs to climb on the kitchen cupboard, I say "No", and he cries. It hurts so much more than I expected. But this is the journey of parenthood, rich in unexpected experiences and feelings.

### A father's confession

BTW. I stumbled upon a father's confession about the inner changes that happened in him after his first baby was born. He realised that his individuality was turned into "duoviduality": http://frankmartela.fi/2012/01/birth-of-a-child-or-when-you-expand-from-an-individual-into-a-duovidual/
It is revealing to hear some testimonials from the world of fathers in the Western societies as well.
