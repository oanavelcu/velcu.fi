At the end of 2012 and beginning of 2013, I have experienced a strong feeling of gratitude for a group of people I have never met but whose sacrifice had a tremendous influence on my destiny. This group of people are the ones who rebelled against the Communist regime in Romania in December 1989. They risked their lives for the right to live in a democratic country.The protests took place from 16 December to 22 December when unarmed people rioted against the guns, tanks, and anti-terrorist troops (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Revolution_of_1989>). I don't know how they must have felt or what must have been the last thoughts in the minds of the protesters who lost their lives during the protests. It took 1104 deaths and 3352 injured protestants to take Ceausescu down.Starting with that bloody December 1989, Romanian people had the right to freedom of speech and expression. I am one of them and each December, I feel indebted to light a candle for those people who died so that I can have the life that I have now.Life is such a dynamic network of connections between people. While we focus on our mini universes, there are moments when our actions benefit other person's life. Our souls are connected at a higher level of existence and in this life, our lives are pieces of a big puzzle of humanity.At the beginning of a new year, I have my heart full of gratitude for being part of this puzzle of humanity and I hope that one day, my actions are going to bring positive changes into other persons lives. Happy New Year! :)
