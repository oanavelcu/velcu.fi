*Making changes in life is a complex process, which can cause lots of confusion. Mindfulness, the ability to focus on the present without being judgemental can help us manage the change in a healthier and more pleasant manner.* 
*When we talk about change in personal life, mindfulness means mainly wrapping ourselves in the love inside and around us. At the same time, it is important to cultivate patience, courage and faith - pillars of mindfulness of change.*

## What is the intuition telling you?

Now when the Spring is sheepishly showing its face, some of us can't help paying attention to their inner voice which says, "A new stage of life transformation is waiting for you."It's not the first life transformation you're going through! Oh no! Your soul and mind remember how it is to be battered with self-doubt, insecurities and fear of failure. Agonising between the lows of disappointment and the highs of envisioned dreams, you may conclude, "Why bother! Life is good the way it is!".For some of us, life is good the way it is, and we are free to reply to our inner voice, "Why don't you bugger off?"

Others say, "You know what, Inner Voice? This new life transformation is part of my destiny. Thank you for reminding me! "

For once, we can make the change happen with less sufferance, and a more positive attitude to change.

## Positive Attitude to Change

*Love:* Focusing on the love inside and around us is the anchor to the present.
Be present both with the body and soul to the dear ones who need us. Find creative ways of spending time together. Be receptive to their needs.
You may think you don't have time. Well, think twice. Don't underestimate the inspiration and creativity that spring from love.

*Patience:* Take the steps towards the new chapter in life, but do keep in mind that patience is a virtue. Be persistent and reassess your strategies.
Life transformation is a complex process that consists of different stages: hearing the inner call to change, searching for ways to make it happen, concrete actions, achievement.

*Courage:* Achievement means living the transformation. There is no such thing as failure. Each transformation brings us closer to who we really are.
The transformed life may not be the way we envisioned it, but it surely feels that's the life we are meant to live.

*Faith:* Hold onto the belief that change has its own timing. Don't be discouraged by the surrounding reality, which does not seem to point in the direction of change.
The way the first bird singing signals that Spring is around the corner, in the same way, the whisper of the inner voice shows that we will get all the help of the Universe to make the transformational stage happen.

Last but not least, take a deep breath, relax and enjoy the ride with all the bumps on the road! This is life!
