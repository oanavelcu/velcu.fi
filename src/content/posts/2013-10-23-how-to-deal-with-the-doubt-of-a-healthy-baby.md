title: How to deal with the doubt of a healthy baby
---

*You think you're having a good life until the moment when you go to an ultrasound to see how your unborn baby is developing. You leave the doctor's office stupefied, chocked, confused and with tears in your eyes. There is a 2% probability that your baby might have a chromosomal abnormality.*
*You decide to do an amniocentesis test to find out with 100% probability if the baby is healthy. Â In 1 to 4 weeks time, you'll get the results.*
*Meanwhile, going about your life as if everything is normal is out of question. How can you handle your fears and stress?*If you are anything like me, you'd start talking to family and close friends. Not that it would change anything, but the affection and love that you feel from them gives you the strength to get off the bed in the morning.
In times like this, you feel even better how much your family loves you! You listen to your friends' encouragements and you feel the positive energy and the strong believe that everything will be fine!
In times like this, you discover new sides of the relationships you have with all these wonderful people. You see how they use their personal believes to give you the best support that they are capable of.

You open up to them in your weakest moments and you discover more similarities with them than you would have thought you have before. One of these similarities is the belief that prayers can do wonders.

And praying many times a day, indeed does wonders. It makes you realise that your faith and your hope is much bigger than your fears. Come what may, but until the day when the truth is revealed, you have your hope to feed on.

Your hope can inspire you to visualise happy moments of the future and can diminish the stress of the present.

You are a human being thrown in the tumult of life, with its uncertainty and unawareness. This moment of waiting is a reminder that all you have is today. So how would you like to live today? How does it sound to spend the day dreaming about a happy tomorrow?

"*Well, yes, but what if tomorrow does not bring happy moments?*", some skeptic voice may argue.

It's probably a matter of personal choice, but if you were to choose between hoping in the present and worrying in the present, what would you choose? Tomorrow's reality will unveil itself when the time comes. Why not embracing it with the courage and peacefulness brought by the hope of today?
