The fundamental drive in life is the pursuit of meaning, writes Viktor Frankl in Man’s Search for Meaning. Through a combination of external and internal circumstances, meaning will come to the surface of conscious awareness. 
Through a grace of God or lucky coincidence, two people intersect. Their souls get swiftly entangled and magnetised. A vibrant energy shakes up their inner lives with the fullness of being. They now see that meaning is life. The meaning of exploring oneself through perceptions, senses, intuitions, interests, play and acts of courage.
