*Making new year resolutions can improve our lives if we diligently work on them. Even if we never carry on with them, by writing down resolutions it gives us the chance to dream of a better life. Yet, if we are wholeheartedly dedicated to our resolutions, there are a few tips to remember in order to avoid disappointment at the end of the year when we do the maths and we see that we are far away from reaching our goals.*
When a new year is about to begin, some of us like to make a list of resolutions. For the last 4 or 5 years, I've made resolutions that would help me live my dreams.
Throughout the year, I would get entangled into the events that life brought in my way and I would lose focus of my resolutions. At the end of the year, I would have feelings of failure and disappointment coming from my incapability to kick-start or complete my personal or professional projects.
Dan Puric, a Romanian actor, once said "*If you want God to laugh, tell him about your plans.*" Many of us don't see the point in making one year plans. Some of us succumb to higher forces of life and cope with life situations that require different skills, emotional reactions and actions than those that would lead to reaching goals.

I am somewhere in between pursuing goals with determination and waiting to see what plans the destiny has in store for me. For example, for years, I've been planning to write a book on spiritual development in a foreign environment. I've started two drafts already. But year after year, I faced other challenges, which required my energy and time that I would have otherwise put into writing my dream book.
I've learned a few things about reaching goals:

1. Have a list of huge and ambitious goals to work on. Keep it short - two, three at maximum.
2. Have some self-discipline and break the big goal into smaller steps to follow through each month of the year.
3. Be ready to put on hold the work on a project in favour of more important life situations that you didn't envisage in the beginning the year (i.e, the birth of your child, the illness of a parent, etc)
4. Keep focus on what is more important, that is your wellbeing. Therefore, no matter what happens, don't beat yourself up if at the end of the year, you have still to work on your list of top goals. As a matter of fact, it is very valuable what you've learned from the unexpected experiences you lived. What insights into yourself did you gain? For example, if you maintained your inner peacefulness through challenging times, most likely you'll have the energy to get back to where you left your work-in-progress.
5. Be flexible to revise and even change your new year resolutions throughout the year. Goals may be too idealistic or unrealistic. Unexpected opportunities may come along. You may lose interest in pursuing a certain goal. For example, you may have aimed at finding a job abroad but then something happens and you realise you want to stay close to your family. You may have aimed at losing 20 kg but by the time you lost 15 kg you feel that it is time to stop because the respective weight is just perfect for you. Life is about change, so allow your goals to change as you gain more insight into your life.

Reaching goals can give feelings of satisfaction, achievement and meaningfulness. Above all, it is a process that challenges our beliefs and skills. If at the end of the process we are better persons than before, than this is the most priceless achievement.
**How about you, do you like making new year resolutions? How do you manage the process of turning them into reality?**
