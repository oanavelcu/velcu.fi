*Being yourself is a complex but very crucial aspect of personal development. The discovery and then development of who you truly are can take a significant amount of time and shake up all your relationships. You may even have to stop doing whatever you're doing to earn your living and start a completely new career.*Your true self, that inner voice that lives in you ever since the beginning of your earthly life, is very well hidden by the teachings of your parents and school and the influence of romantic partners and friends.You want to please your parents and partner by obeying their wishes of who you should be. You want to be a good student and work hard even for subjects for which you don't feel any inner motivation. You want to be appreciated by friends and you change your behaviour and attitude appropriately.

The emotional need to be loved and the social need to be accepted and appreciated silence the inner voice of being who you truly are - the human being who came into this life to live in authenticity, integrity, morality and freedom of expression.

If you are lucky, it comes a moment when you are awakened and you feel how the inner voice is vibrating in your body and talking to your soul. It can be that you are awakened after a moment when you face death or after a painful break-up. Then, you feel the need to escape from the roles that you've played so far and to start living according to how your inner voice guides you.This inner voice is your connection to God, to the Higher Intelligence, and if you are wise to listen to it, it will bring you to the home of Divinity with every experience you start living as being your true self.

The first steps towards being yourself require courage. You'll have to manage the confusion and disappointment of the loved ones who will start witnessing a new behaviour. Their expectations on you are no longer fulfilled. They'll have to learn to accept your true nature and this may be extremely difficult for them.

You'll also need tact and patience with your loved ones until they learn to appreciate the real you and your way of showing how you love them.

You'll need strength when some friends stop contacting you because they see in you a different person, around whom they may not want to be. Actually, it does not matter why they don't need your company anymore. The important and valuable aspect is that whatever you do as your true self is in alignment with your divine being.

Your thoughts and emotions purify and they'll result in beneficial actions as well. In time, you'll be surprised how much happier you'll be with your relationships and professional life.Becoming your true self does not happen overnight but if you stay faithful to the inner voice, you'll eventually manage to break free from old and toxic habits, such as the need to be praised for doing things in which you don't genuinely believe. You'll laugh with all your heart and you'll feel truly alive and in communion with God!
