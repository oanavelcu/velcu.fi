*As our parents are getting old, there are some sides of their personality which worsen. The love for them gives us the energy to stand by their side. And we need lots of energy! Maintaining our inner balance can be a challenge and an opportunity for personal growth.*

You too must have a special person whom you call first when you have a joy or sorrow to share. It comes a time when it's your turn to be by her side.

You tap into the most empathic and compassionate side of yourself and you listen. You've learned from previous experiences that it's better to be silent.

Previously, you may have tried to be helpful with positive arguments and solutions.

Alas, every single time, the unawareness kept her as hostage in a world of gloom and fears.

This time you'll take a different approach - you'll absorb the negative thoughts.

Her soul is tormented and you can't do anything about it. You can only love her because she's your mother!On verge of falling in the abyss of desolation, you realise that the ultimate help is for you to stay present and keep the joy alive.The joy and hope she'll have more constructive thoughts too.In your heart, there is the memory of her - an energetic fighter, kind to you. Today, she's been ageing.

Today, your relationship has changed. You are her shoulder to cry on from now.

You look at your child and you see your mother in you - when she was young.

Time is irreversibly changing you and her. You can only hold onto the gratefulness that she's in your life.

It is painful to watch your mother ageing. Each one of us identifies partly with their parents and when they decline, a part of us goes with them.

A new phase starts when the roles have changed - you're the parent and she's the child.

**Now, about you - how do you cope seeing your parents ageing? How has your relationship with them changed?**
