As a child, I used to look up to my parents and other adult relatives because they seemed to have figured out who they are and how they wanted to live. 
Now when I am an adult, I realise we, adults don’t really know what we are doing. Moreover, we feel like a failure because we should be knowing what we are doing.
Harsh criticism. Tit for tat attitudes. Peer expectations. Social pressure. These are things that disturb the mind.
And then, we can do one simple thing well - we can breathe.
Breathe now
Breathe in life
Breathe out gratitude
Observe the breath
Get curious about the new possibilities to deeper awareness.
