This morning, as I was walking with my son, with the corner of my eye, I could see a young woman and man catching up with us, on their electric kick-bikes. The young woman, my son and I were about to enter the same building, when we could hear the young man’s voice, shouting from the distance, *“I love you!”* And he continued his way somewhere else where he is needed. 
Imagine the emotional impact on the young woman. How uplifted she must have started her day!
No matter if we have someone who loves us, wouldn’t it be nice to start our days, being in love with the day that it’s about to unfold?
Hearing empowering music in our minds.
Engaging playfully with the daily activities.
Daydreaming and smiling.
Wouldn't it be nice?
