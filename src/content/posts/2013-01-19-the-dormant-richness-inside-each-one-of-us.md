## Where does happiness come from?

"Happiness consists more in small conveniences or pleasures that occur every day, than in great pieces of good fortune that happen but seldom.", Benjamin Franklin, the Founding Father of USA.

Most certainly, it is easy to agree with Benjamin Franklin's view on happiness. We all have our small joys in life, such as watching a TV series or going to an ice-hockey game in the weekend. The problem is that we don't perceive these small joys as real and long-lasting happiness. Instead, our minds are wired to chase the happiness, which comes from the "good fortune". And this is how we go through life feeling empty, depressed, miserable, self-disillusioned and bitter.

The hope helps us survive the bottom line. We will be happy when we find love, when we get our dream job, when I get promoted, when we become a mother, when our sexual life gets better, when we are rich, after I divorce, etc. Yet, all these future expectations are beguiling and the very source of unhappiness. For example, if you do become rich, there will always be room for making more money. Therefore, the chase after happiness continues and the present is a struggle. Or, if you do get promoted, you may be disillusioned to realise that it is not bringing as much happiness as you expected.

## Are there any chance for us human beings to be happy at certain points in our lifetime?

Research on happiness has flourished in the last ten years, offering to individuals self-help tips on how to find their own happiness. Here are few books, which I consider worthy of mentioning: [Sonja Lyubormiski, The Myths of Happiness](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594204373/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flyingthought-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594204373), and [Robert Biswas-Diener and Ed Diener, Unlocking The Mysteries of Psychological Wealth](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1405146613/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flyingthought-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1405146613). Scientific studies show that we can at least reach happy moods and irrespective of what causes these happy moods, they "lead people to be more productive, more likeable, more active, more healthy, more friendly, more helpful, more resilient, and more creative." ([Sonja Lyubomirsky, The How of Happiness](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143114956/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flyingthought-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0143114956), pp. 265)

Have you ever made this test to observe people from the distance? If you did, I am sure you agree that you can spot the unhappy ones by the way they carry themselves. Especially in the case of us women, the gloomy atmosphere in our minds reflects in our body movements.

Has it ever happened to you to adopt new ways of thinking for few days and think you are finally happy just before you slide back into the old way of viewing the world? Is sustainable happiness but an abstract concept that exists in the work of psychologists such as Sonja Lyubomirsky?

## Can we reach a steady level of happiness?

How we relate to happiness differs from one individual to another, depending on our genetical heritage, our childhood and adulthood experiences. However, I strongly believe that we all can find our glimpses of long-lasting happiness by digging out the dusty characteristics which make us human.

Compassion, empathy, love, gratitude, altruism, soul-to-soul connection: they all live in us, the problem is that they have been forgotten. The age of science has brought wonderful advancements into the world at the cost of taking us away from who we really are: human beings.

If we want to be happy, we need to take a good look inside and cultivate the seeds of all these characteristics that make us human. Yes, it hurts when we feel that there is not love in our life. While we are waiting for love, we'd benefit from turning our face and soul towards the people around us and offer them the crumbles of love that there are in us. When we hear about a sick person who needs money for surgery, why not donating few euros from our income? Why not joining a group of people with similar interests?

Life happens now and we fool ourselves if we think we have control over it and we'll be happy tomorrow. If we can control something, well that something is the humanity in us. The happiness will follow it.
