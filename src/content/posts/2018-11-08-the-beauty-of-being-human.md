title: The Beauty of Being Human
---

**Each human interaction has a flavour**
 **Some flavours are the perfect match for the heart,**
 **enriching it.**
 **The rest are opening the mind to other realities.**
 **We meet a new person.**
 **We feel what she might feel in the moment.**
 **We start talking, we get a glimpse into her experiences.**
 **Beyond feelings and perspectives,**
 **We feel an energy that is specific to that person.**
 **I don't know how a psychologist would call this energy.**
 **I call it the transcendent soul.**
