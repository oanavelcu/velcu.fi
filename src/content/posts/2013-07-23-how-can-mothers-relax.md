*Some people have a talent at relaxing. Others need to learn to relax. Especially when becoming mothers, it may be wise to take time for ourselves ever since the kids are small. A relaxed mind is fit for coping with our kids' needs as they grow.*

## It is important, yet so difficult to relax

Engrossed in the responsibilities of a mother, I've neglected one important aspect: to relax!

It took me almost two years to become aware of my mental fatigue. I now understand other friends who said that the first years of parenthood can be tiring.

Complaining about it may help to let some steam off, but it's a temporary solution.

## Ways to relax

It's up to us to figure out tiny positive changes to our daily life. Here are eleven examples of how we can make time to relax during busy days with toddlers running and shouting around us:

1. In the morning, despite that the baby decides that it's time to wake up, we can still linger in bed for 3 minutes. It's sufficient time to focus our attention on our mind, body and soul.
2. We may smile. We can salute the new day, "A precious day of my life is about to start!". We can take deep breaths that cleanse our organs.
3. After the 3 minutes are gone, we are ready to hug and kiss our kids. Caresses, hugs and kisses from the partner warm the heart and remind us that there is love in the house. And as a symbol of that love, we'll do the daily routines.
4. During breakfast, we'd better avoid thinking about the need-to-do tasks of the day. Instead, we'd better take the time to chit-chat with our partner.
5. The day starts rolling and we are on the road. If we are driving, we can take a slightly different route so that its novelty can take our mind away from whatever we might be tempted to sort out.
6. If we travel by bus or tram, we can indulge ourselves into a fast but efficient meditation. We can detach ourselves from the surrounding and focus on breathing, thus connecting to our body. We can thank our body for enabling us to carry on with the day.
7. When the kids are taking a nap, we can rest as well, by using a head massager, for example.
8. Before putting our babies to sleep, we can spend together 30 minutes listening to soothing music. Or watching some photos - family photos, landscapes - that we discuss about with our toddlers.
9. When all the members of the family are already in bed, we have the luxury to take a hot shower. Using our favourite shower gel with relaxing scent can help to calm down.
10. When we put the head on the pillow, there's another habit that we can take up - to think happy thoughts or say a prayer if the connection to God is important to us.
11. Once a week, we can have the mommy pampering evening when we spend two hours on our own - going to a massage centre, meeting a close friend, doing some sports we like, reading a book in a cafe, etc.  Whatever makes us relax and forget about the responsibilities of being a mother.

## Take away thought

To me, relaxing is similar to doing sports. Twenty minutes of exercise three times a week are more efficient than one hour of exercise, once a week.

Considering how chaotic the family life with kids can be, knowing how to relax daily is crucial for the wellbeing of mothers. Happy mother means happy kids and family.

Let's choose to relax this moment. You're on a beach, the breeze is gently caressing your face. The smell of the sea is spoiling your senses just before you can hear your little one's laughter. He approaches and pinches you, "Mommy, play with me!"
