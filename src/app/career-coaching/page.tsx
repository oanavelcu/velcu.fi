                      &ldquo;Do you remember that I asked you the first class if I should apply to a dream job even if I don&rsquo;t fulfil all the requirements. Well, I did, and even if I did not get that precise job it got me very much further in many ways. I started getting much more freelance jobs from this employer, and it seems like we will co-operate much closer than ever before. So it really pays off to apply even though you would not be completely qualified for a certain job. Thank you again for a thought-provoking and inspiring class.&rdquo;

                      &ldquo;The group discussions, discussions in pairs and the online tests. All of these gave good insight to my personal situation, and to my strengths and weaknesses. The course did not throw &lsquo;the grand revelation&rsquo; at my face, but it really helped. During the course I started to get some confirmation of the direction I want to take, at least for now. Just for your information, my boss asked me about 10 months ago what I would like to do professionally in an ideal situation &ndash; at the time I did not have an answer for him. Already during the course I could now give him an answer. One thing led to another and now I have a new title in that area &ndash; just a title, but it&rsquo;s a start. Whether this is something I really want to do in the future is questionable, but like discussed in the course, it&rsquo;s worth exploring, right?&rdquo;

Also, Oana&rsquo;s naturally positive character and enthusiasm, genuine care and compassion provided a gem of a space for expressing those feelings, sharing with others, and also generating ideas for transforming one&rsquo;s experience through positivity and creativity. The benefit is that in some way it was almost a healing process of some hardships of being a foreigner.

                    The course consisted of 8 seminars, in which we covered topics such as awareness, self-compassion, empathy, generosity, awe, gratitude, love and forgiveness. These topics were tackled from both a spiritual and positive psychology standpoint. Each seminar took about one hour, by the end of which, the participants were endowed with a set of techniques to cultivate their happiness.
